| **3** | **Board Abstraction Clustering & VRAM Validation** | What are the optimal k values for flop, turn, river buckets within 11GB VRAM? How good is cluster separation? | 1\. Generate canonical flop list; sample turn/river boards. 2\. Implement K-Means clustering (using scikit-learn) with K-Means++ init. 3\. Run clustering experiments for various k on flop, turn, river using features from Sprint 2\. 4\. Estimate VRAM for SD-CFR with resulting bucket counts and target NN size. Select final k values. 5\. Save k-means models. | data/board\_abstraction\_models/kflop.joblib, kturn.joblib, kriver.joblib. notebooks/board\_abstraction\_analysis.ipynb. Report on k selection and VRAM estimates. | Optimal k values for flop, turn, river selected and models saved. VRAM estimates confirm \<11GB target. | python src/abstraction/run\_clustering.py \--street flop \--k 500 (example) |
