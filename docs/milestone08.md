| **8** | **Simulation, Validation & Final Packaging** | Validate FEDOR.ppl against performance targets. Document and package project. | 1\. Conduct full Simulation & Validation Plan (Sec 7): Oracle H2H (or strategy matching), positional stats, archetype testing, timing tell analysis. 2\. Analyze results, iterate on PPL/DLL if minor fixes needed. 3\. Finalize make\_fedor.py script. 4\. Complete all documentation (README, section reports). 5\. Package all project artefacts for delivery. | Final FEDOR.ppl, FEDOR/ folder structure populated. Validation report (docs/validation\_report.md). Final README.md. | FEDOR.ppl meets or exceeds \-1bb/100 vs oracle. All validation tests passed. Project fully documented and packaged. | python make\_fedor.py \--all, python run\_validation\_suite.py |
