| **4** | **PokerRL SD-CFR Setup & Initial Training Cycle (Small Segment)** | Can PokerRL with SD-CFR be configured for a small NLH segment using custom abstractions? FP16 integration. | 1\. Setup PokerRL TrainingProfile for SD-CFR. 2\. Implement custom PokerRL game environment for a small segment of 5-max NLH (e.g., a specific preflop line, flop only, using 10-20 flop buckets). 3\. Integrate FP16 (autocast, GradScaler) into PokerRL training loop if not native. 4\. Run a short (1-2 day) test training cycle on the RTX 4070 Ti. Monitor convergence, VRAM, speed. | src/mccfr\_training/custom\_game\_env.py, src/mccfr\_training/profiles/test\_profile.py, scripts/run\_poker\_rl\_test.sh. Report on test cycle results. | PokerRL training pipeline functional for a small custom segment with abstractions and FP16. Initial performance metrics gathered. | bash scripts/run\_poker\_rl\_test.sh |
