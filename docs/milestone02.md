| **2** | **Bet Tree Design & Initial Board Abstraction Features** | Finalize recursive bet-tree logic (max raises, SPR\<1 rule). Define comprehensive feature set for board abstraction. | 1\. Formalize bet-tree generation algorithm (Sec 2), including all bet sizes and recursive raise logic. 2\. Research & define feature vector for board states (suits, pairedness, connectivity, high-card tiers) for flop, turn, river (Sec 3). 3\. Implement Python functions to extract these features from canonical board representations. | docs/bet\_tree\_design.md, src/abstraction/board\_features.py, src/abstraction/tests/test\_board\_features.py. | Bet-tree logic documented. Board feature extraction functions implemented and unit tested. | python \-m unittest src/abstraction/tests/test\_board\_features.py |
