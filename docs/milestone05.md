| **5** | **Full MCCFR Training Cycle 1 (Key Postflop Segment)** | Can a significant postflop segment converge adequately within 7 days? Hyperparameter tuning. | 1\. Select a key, complex postflop segment (e.g., BTN vs BB SRP, using full flop/turn buckets from Sprint 3). 2\. Refine SD-CFR hyperparameters (LR, batch size, network architecture choice like dense\_residual) based on Sprint 4\. 3\. Launch a full 7-day training cycle for this segment. 4\. Monitor convergence (exploitability if measurable, loss curves), VRAM, GPU util. | data/mccfr\_solver\_outputs/segment1\_strategy.json, logs/segment1\_training.log. Report on training cycle 1\. | First major postflop segment trained for 7 days. Strategy output saved. Convergence metrics documented. | bash scripts/train\_segment.sh \--segment\_config configs/segment1.json |
